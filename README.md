### 🔬 Cancer Prediction Visualizer

An interactive, containerized machine learning application that trains a PyTorch neural network on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and visualizes the outcomes using Matplotlib. 

Built with a decoupled microservice architecture: a FastAPI backend handles the heavy ML computations and image rendering, while a Streamlit frontend serves as the interactive web dashboard.

### 🚀 Quick Start 
Prerequisites 

     Docker Desktop  installed and running.
     Python 3.10+ installed
     

Run the Application 

Clone or download this repository. 
Open a terminal in the project root directory. 
Run the following command:
bash
     
```   
git clone https://github.com/LorexGitHub/cancer-predictor.git
cd cancer-predictor
docker compose up --build  
```
      
Wait for the terminal to display: You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser. 
Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8501  

(To stop the application, press Ctrl+C in your terminal).
