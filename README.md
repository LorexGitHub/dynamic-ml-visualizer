```
Key Model Design Choices
- Dynamic Input Layer: The model automatically re-initializes its input dimension when the user swaps datasets (e.g., 30 features for Cancer, 15 for Churn).
- Dropout (p=0.2): Randomly disables 20% of neurons during training to prevent overfitting on small datasets.
- Sigmoid Output: Compresses the final neuron into a probability, thresholded at 0.5 for binary classification.

### 🚀 Quick Start 
Prerequisites 

     Docker Desktop  installed and running.
     Python 3.10+ installed
     

Run the Application 

Clone or download this repository. 
Open a terminal in the project root directory. 
Run the following command:
```   
docker compose up --build  
```
      
Wait for the terminal to display: You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser. 
Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8501  

(To stop the application, press Ctrl+C in your terminal).
